## Introduction
Heya! I'm Adrian Kuśmierek and it's a pleasure to meet you!

I come from Poland and I love biscuits ^w^
## Something About Me
I'm a self-taught "developer". Aka just some guy who tries to code ^^

I can code in a variety of different languages like:
- C++
- HTML
- CSS

But I mostly code in <b>JavaScript</b>, because, ehh.. Yes.

I guess it isn't the fastest language but to me it's the most comfortable.

Especially with the functionality NodeJS adds to it!
## Have a nice day!
Anyways, yeah. If you wanna have a look around my profile, go for it!

Cheers,
Adrian.
