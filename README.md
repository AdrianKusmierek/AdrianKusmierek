## Introduction
Heya! I'm Adrian Kuśmierek and it's a pleasure to meet you!

I come from Poland and I'm happy you visited my profile.
## Something About Me
I'm a self-taught "developer". Aka just some guy who tries to code ^^

I can code in a variety of different languages like:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- C#

But I mostly code in <b>JavaScript</b> simply because I love how much functionality and potential it has with NodeJS.

It might not be the fastest language but to me it's the most comfortable.

```js
var happy = false;
	
function getHappy() {
	happy = true;
}

if (!happy) {
	getHappy();
}
```
## Take a look around!
Either way! Go ahead and take a look around my profile, and the projects I'm working on!

Cheers,
Adrian.
