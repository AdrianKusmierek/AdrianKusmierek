## Introduction
Heya! I'm Adrian Kuśmierek and it's a pleasure to meet you!

I come from Poland and I'm happy you visited my profile.
## Something About Me
I'm a self-taught "developer". Aka just some guy who tries to code ^^

I can code in a variety of different languages like:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- C#

But I mostly code in <b>JavaScript</b> simply because I love how much functionality and potential it has with NodeJS.

It might not be the fastest language but to me it's the most comfortable.

```js
const mood = require("emotions");

mood.once("change", mood => {
   if (mood != "happy") {
      mood = "happy";

      console.log("I'm happi now ^w^");
   } else {
      console.log("I was happi already! :3");
   }
});
```
## Take a look around!
Either way! Go ahead and take a look around my profile, and the projects I'm working on!

Cheers,
Adrian.
